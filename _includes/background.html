      I'm currently a QA Automation intern at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.menlosecurity.com/" target="_blank">Menlo Security</a> making lives easier for my coworkers. I'm also studying Computer Science at
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://foothill.edu/cs/" target="_blank">Foothill College</a> with a plan to transfer to a University of California upon graduation.

      As a software developer, I strive to develop applications that are both efficient and user-friendly. My drive for coding comes
      from knowing I've built well-designed products that users will love to use and recommend to their friends and families.

      When I'm not in front of a computer screen, I'm probably hanging out with my girlfriend, riding around the Bay Area
      on my road bike, sitting out in the sun with my dog, or 
      <a class="underline-link" href="https://cedric.tech/blog" target="_blank">writing about whatever is on my mind</a> at the moment.
